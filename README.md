# Projects

* ## [Advent of Code](https://mweiss9676.github.io/AdventCalendarCSharp/) 
     
     What is it?
     * A series of coding challenges with a progressive difficulty scale for every day in the month of December
     * This challenge has made me a much better programmer and taught me about File IO, LINQ, Regex, OOP, data structures, critical-      thinking, and algorithm design.

* ## [National Parks Weather Service](http://nationalparkweatherservice.apphb.com/)

     What is it?
     * A .NET Framework application utilizing MVC to display local weather and information for our national parks. Went beyond the scope of the assignment by implementing Json data to streamline the data exchange, and implemented real weather data using a weather API in place of the built in SQL data.

* ## [The Form Group](https://mweiss9676.github.io/Form-Group/)

     What is it?
     * A copy of The Form Group's website
     * The Form Group is a shop dedicated to helping non-profits in the art community realize their goals through web-based applications and digital events. Their web design is incredible and I learned a lot just by copying their work. Note: the mobile version of the site is all that is completed so far.

* ## [National Park Reservation System](https://mweiss9676.github.io/Park-Reservation-System/)

     What is it?
     * A C# console application which interfaces with Microsoft SQL Server to schedule and verify campsite reservations across three major park systems. Completed the bonus requirements for park-wide searching and implemented a GUI for usability.

* ## [Vending Machine](https://mweiss9676.github.io/CircusOfValue/)

     What is it?
     * Built in C# and the .NET framework. Went above the scope of the assignment to increase usability and customer experience by adding increased functionality and a full-featured GUI in a console application including scrolling animations and the ability to remove items from the shopping cart on the fly.
