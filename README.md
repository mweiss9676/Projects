# Some of the projects I'm currently working on 

* ## Advent of Code 
     
     What is it?
     * A series of coding challenges with a progressive difficulty scale for every day in the month of December
     * This challenge has made me a much better programmer and taught me about File IO, LINQ, Regex, OOP, data structures, critical-      thinking, and algorithm design.

* ## National Parks Weather Service

     What is it?
     * A .NET Framework application utilizing MVC to display local weather and information for our national parks. Went beyond the scope of the assignment by implementing Json data to streamline the data exchange, and implemented real weather data using a weather API in place of the built in SQL data.
